              <p class="bg-aqua-verde pa3 shadow-4">Between worldwide climate strikes, panic over COVID-19 and the urgent call of Black Lives Matter, the Milieux Institute was challenged in 2019-20 to rethink the meaning of our work and mandate. As an interdisciplinary collective, we rely heavily on meeting and working together in the physical spaces of our labs and studios. The anti-climax of a campus lockdown in the Spring of 2020 came as quite a blow. As you read this in the future, you know how that experience was just the beginning.</p>
              <p class="bg-aqua-verde pa3 shadow-4">This year was also the 100th anniversary of Bauhaus—the famous Weimar-era art school credited with innovations in art, design and education that survive today. We saw in this centennial an opportunity to explore Milieux’s relationship to Bauhaus influences with a weeklong festival of talks, performances, workshops and installations in November 2020. Faculty and students from across our eight clusters gathered for an experience that was less a celebration of Bauhaus, than an intensive, critical interrogation of its legacy for our current moment. We also took stock of the prominent eurocentrism in art and design pedagogy, and played with ideas for shaping the future of the Milieux; grabbing what continues to be inspirational about Bauhaus without the need for genuflection.</p>
              <p class="bg-aqua-verde pa3 shadow-4">For us, the Bauhausian question of the role of art, craft and design in helping to make better communities has turned into exploring the role of research-creation or practice-based research for the training of students, the production of new knowledge and technology, and the support of social and cultural change. In Spring 2020 the Hexagram network received seven years of renewed funding from the Quebec government to rigorously document and examine research-creation methodology in Quebec and beyond. Milieux is an anchor partner on this grant which connects us closely to colleagues at UQAM and other Quebec universities and indeed to the world. We carried out Bauhausian style experiments through collaborative process-based work on virtual reality, artificial intelligence, fermentationbioplastics, ethnography, embodied performance and even COVID mask design.</p>
              <p class="bg-aqua-verde shadow-4 pa3">Spring 2020 also brought the welcome news that our indigenous futures cluster won formal research centre status at Concordia. This is critical development in this moment, and we look forward to welcoming more indigenous faculty and students to what is sure to one of the most vibrant new research centres in Canada. In addition we developed a range of commitments in support of Black Lives Matters with hope of extending access and attention to people of colour at the Institute and addressing ourselves to the range of injustices and inequalities that persist in our domains of art, culture and technology.</p>
              <p class="bg-aqua-verde pa3 shadow-4">Moving forward we have a world under COVID to deal with, but our faculty, staff and students continue to work hard with collaborators around the world. There are new grant proposals under way, a major renovation to our spaces in the works and the potential of new PhD program taking shape. There is still plenty of work to do and we look forwarding to doing it, together.</p>
