          "description": "Building upon generative intersections of critical security studies and science and technology studies (STS), Prof. of sociology Lucy Suchman argued in this talk that the promotion of automated data analysis under the sign of artificial intelligence can only serve to exacerbate military operations that are at once discriminatory and indiscriminate in their targeting, while remaining politically and legally unaccountable. She closed with some thoughts on how we might interrupt the workings of these apparatuses, in the service of wider movements for social justice.",

Inspired by our Jonas Salk bacterial portraits that we created with TAG’s Jess Marcotte this summer and based on a workshop developed by WhiteFeather Hunter—as well as research done by our homegrown research-creation team: The Bactinctorium—the lab decided to explore the use of the pigment producing bacteria Serratia marcences for petri dish portraiture.<br/><br/>Read more <a class='link black underline dim' href='https://speculativelifebiolab.com/2020/01/28/bacterial-portraiture-day-i/' target='_blank'>here</a>",

In January 2020, they launched the Ghost River Project: an interactive map of one of Montreal’s lost rivers. The project pieces together the pasts, presents, and possible futures of Saint Pierre, a major waterway that cut across the West of the island for much of its history. Canalized and buried underground throughout the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, the river now exists as a ghost, haunting the city’s landscape, infrastructure, and historical imagination.<br/><br/>See the project <a class='link black underline dim' href='https://ethnographylabconcordia.ca/ghostriver' target='_blank'>here</a>",
